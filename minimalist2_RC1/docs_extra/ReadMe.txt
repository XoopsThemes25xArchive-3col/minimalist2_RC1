----- MINIMALIST ----------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------
-- ACCESSIBLE THEME FRAMEWORK FOR XOOPS  ----------------
---------------------------------------------------------

Minimalist is intended to be a layout for Xoops builded to reach three main results:
accessibilty, usability and flexibility.
The main target is to build a basic yet solid and simple theme, accessible for nearly eace userr type,
with top readibilty of contents and fast customization.

It's not a cool graphic theme and not stilsh as well. It's  intended to be the starting base for all those developers wanting to build 
a tabeleless, multicolumn, ready to use layout with high browser compatibility.
It's a theme which better suits to devlopers or designers but it's anyway complete and ready for any xoops portal.
